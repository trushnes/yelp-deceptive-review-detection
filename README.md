### Dataset

The yelp dataset that I have used in this project is available on request on the mail: srayana@cs.stonybrook.edu


### Model Training

I have used 5 machine learning algorithms which are : 1) Decision Tree 2) Bagging Classifier 3) Random Foreset 4) KNN 5) AdaBoost
and finally I have ensembled all these 5 trained algorithms in hard majority voting classifier.
